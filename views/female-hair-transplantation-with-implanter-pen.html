        The FUE method is performed by inserting the grafts one by one into the needles (0.6mm, 0.8mm) which are called very thin implanter and angle with the help of these needles. Depending on the request of the patient and the recommendations of
        the Doctor, a process that will take 4-8 hours will be placed in the area without needing normal hair. This technique does not use scalpel or scalpel. There is no grooving in the area to be planted and more natural results are obtained as it
        provides the planting in the same direction and angle with the directions of the existing hair and allows for frequent cultivation.
